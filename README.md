HiLo Game 

This is a repo we are using to learn more about git flow, testing and continuous integration.

What we are using?

Using Python 3 version.

Pytest is used for testing.

Why we are doing this?

We feel we need more hands on experience the work and process despite there may be have error in the code.

Have the chance of making anything epic or develop more interesting codes in the near future.
